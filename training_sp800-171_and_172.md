# NIST SP 800‑171 Revision 3 and SP 800‑172r3: Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information

Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is sensitive data that is not
classified but still requires protection.  NIST’s SP 800‑171 provides
security requirements for protecting CUI in non‑federal systems.  In 2023–2025
NIST released **Revision 3** of SP 800‑171 and a companion draft, SP 800‑172r3,
which introduces enhanced security requirements for high‑value assets.

## Changes in SP 800‑171 Revision 3

* **Alignment with SP 800‑53 Rev 5:** The requirements are updated to be
  consistent with the broader catalog of security controls【325330112921909†L134-L154】.
* **Clarified language and fewer requirements:** The revision reduces the
  number of individual requirements while adding detail to remove
  ambiguity and make expectations clearer【325330112921909†L134-L154】.
* **Tailoring and flexibility:** A new set of tailoring criteria helps
  organizations prioritize controls based on risk.  The revision
  introduces **organization‑defined parameters (ODP)** that allow
  organizations to set certain values themselves, increasing flexibility【325330112921909†L134-L154】.
* **Prototype CUI overlay:** The revision includes a prototype overlay that
  shows how requirements apply to different types of CUI【325330112921909†L134-L154】.

A small business primer (NISTIR 1318) accompanies the revision.  It
summarizes the requirements in plain language, highlights key changes from
Revision 2 and provides tips for implementation【541925934544444†L119-L150】.

## Enhanced security in SP 800‑172r3 and assessment procedures

SP 800‑172r3 (final public draft) adds requirements for organizations that
handle **critical systems or high‑value assets**.  These enhanced controls
support cyber resiliency and map to SP 800‑160 engineering principles【125922300043280†L165-L202】.
A companion document, **SP 800‑172Ar3**, provides assessment
procedures based on SP 800‑53A that organizations can use to verify that
controls are in place【125922300043280†L188-L193】.

Both documents implement a one‑time revision number change to align with
SP 800‑171r3 and the forthcoming SP 800‑171Ar3 assessment guide【125922300043280†L188-L193】.

## Significance

The updates modernize the protection of CUI by aligning with current
controls, clarifying expectations and enabling flexibility.  Organizations
that contract with the federal government should review the revised
requirements and assessment procedures to ensure their systems meet the new
standard.  Small businesses can use the primer as an accessible starting
point【541925934544444†L119-L150】.

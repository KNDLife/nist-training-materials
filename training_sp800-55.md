# NIST SP 800‑55 Volumes 1 & 2: Measurement Guide for Information Security

Measuring the effectiveness of security controls helps organizations understand
how well they are protecting their systems and where improvements are needed.
NIST’s SP 800‑55 has been updated and split into **two volumes** to make
measurement guidance clearer and more actionable.  The December 2024
updates reorganize the material and add new concepts【622659980874764†L2318-L2362】【608797136786526†L1562-L1594】.

## What changed

* **Two‑volume structure:** The guide is now divided into Volume 1
  (Overview) and Volume 2 (Roles and Implementation).  Roles and
  responsibilities, which previously appeared in the main document, are
  moved to Volume 2【622659980874764†L2318-L2362】.
* **Removed legislative drivers:** Outdated legislative and strategic
  drivers have been removed to focus the guide on measurement itself【622659980874764†L2318-L2362】【608797136786526†L1562-L1594】.
* **New sections on terminology and fundamentals:** Both volumes include
  sections that explain key terms and the purpose of measurement.  This helps
  readers establish a common understanding【608797136786526†L1562-L1594】.
* **Reorganized measurement considerations:** Content on selecting and
  prioritizing measures has been expanded.  New subsections discuss
  documentation, **data quality** and **uncertainty** when interpreting
  measurements【622659980874764†L2318-L2362】.
* **Efficiency vs. effectiveness:** The guide now distinguishes between
  measuring how efficiently controls operate and how effective they are in
  reducing risk【622659980874764†L2318-L2362】.
* **Appendix updates:** Candidate measures have been removed from the
  appendices, while new appendices provide a **data analysis dictionary**
  and information on modeling measurement results【622659980874764†L2318-L2362】.

## Why it matters

Security measurement is complex.  By splitting the document and adding
foundational explanations, NIST makes the guidance easier to follow for both
technical and non‑technical audiences.  The focus on data quality and
uncertainty encourages organizations to collect reliable metrics and be
transparent about limitations.  Ultimately, the updated SP 800‑55 helps
organizations build measurement programs that inform risk decisions and
improve cybersecurity【622659980874764†L2318-L2362】.

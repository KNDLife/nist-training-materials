# NIST SP 800‑88 Revision 2: Guidelines for Media Sanitization

When data storage devices reach the end of their life or are repurposed, it is
important to remove all sensitive information so that it cannot be recovered.
NIST’s SP 800‑88 provides guidance on **media sanitization**—the process of
rendering data unrecoverable.  A draft **Revision 2** modernizes these
guidelines to address new technologies and practices【309185341751217†L123-L141】.

## What’s new

* **Program‑level focus:** The revision emphasizes establishing an
  enterprise‑wide media sanitization program.  Instead of only listing
  techniques, it guides organizations on how to manage sanitization as a
  coordinated effort【309185341751217†L123-L141】.
* **Updated technique references:** Detailed descriptions of sanitization
  methods have been removed.  Instead, the document points to current
  standards and resources, ensuring that techniques remain up to date【309185341751217†L123-L141】.
* **Validation of effectiveness:** New guidance highlights the need to
  validate that sanitization methods actually remove data.  This reduces
  the risk of residual information being recovered【309185341751217†L123-L141】.
* **Logical sanitization:** The concept of *logical* sanitization is
  introduced.  It acknowledges cloud and virtualized environments where
  physical destruction is impractical.  Logical methods focus on
  cryptographically erasing data or removing all references to it【309185341751217†L123-L141】.
* **Updated references:** Obsolete references have been removed and
  replaced with current standards and best practices【309185341751217†L123-L141】.

## Why this matters

Data remnants can lead to breaches if devices are reused or sold.  The updated
SP 800‑88 guides organizations to treat sanitization as part of their risk
management program and to use current, verifiable techniques.  This helps
ensure that sensitive information does not leak when hardware is disposed of or
returned to vendors【309185341751217†L123-L141】.

# NIST SP 800‑63 Revision 4: Digital Identity Guidelines

Digital identity systems allow people to prove who they are when accessing
online services.  NIST’s SP 800‑63 provides guidance on identity proofing,
authentication and federation.  **Revision 4**, released in 2023–2024,
updates the guidelines to reflect changes in technology and the threat
landscape【274563659197935†L184-L220】.

## Key updates

* **Risk management context:** The document now ties identity proofing and
  authentication decisions to an organization’s broader risk management
  process.  Agencies and organizations are encouraged to assess threats and
  impacts before deciding how strict identity verification should be【274563659197935†L184-L220】.
* **Continuous evaluation metrics:** New metrics help organizations
  periodically re‑evaluate whether an identity is still trustworthy.  This
  reflects a shift away from one‑time verification toward ongoing
  monitoring【274563659197935†L184-L220】.
* **Expanded fraud requirements:** The revision expands requirements for
  detecting and preventing fraud.  It includes guidance on detecting
  injection attacks and forged media (e.g., deepfakes) during identity
  proofing【274563659197935†L184-L220】.
* **Support for new authenticators:** Revision 4 explicitly supports
  *syncable authenticators* such as **passkeys** and allows for
  **subscriber‑controlled wallets** that store digital credentials on a
  person’s device【274563659197935†L184-L220】.
* **Password changes:** The guidance updates expectations around password
  composition and rotation.  It discourages periodic password resets unless
  there is evidence of compromise and encourages multi‑factor authentication.

## Why it matters

Identity systems underpin many online services, from banking to health care.
Revision 4 recognizes that attackers increasingly use sophisticated tactics,
like deepfakes, to impersonate people.  By linking identity requirements to
risk and enabling modern authenticators, the guidelines aim to strengthen
security while improving user experience.  Organizations should update
identity policies and systems to align with the new guidance and protect
users from evolving threats【274563659197935†L184-L220】.

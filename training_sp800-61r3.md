# NIST SP 800‑61 Revision 3: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide

Organizations must be prepared to detect, respond to and recover from cyber
incidents.  NIST’s SP 800‑61 has long provided guidance on incident response.
**Revision 3**, released in 2024, updates the guide to align with the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 and to reflect modern threats【89264104650161†L470-L648】.

## New incident response model

Previous versions of SP 800‑61 described a linear incident response life
cycle (preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and
recovery, and post‑incident activity).  Revision 3 maps incident response
activities to the **CSF 2.0 functions**:

1. **Govern** – establish policies, roles and metrics for incident response.
2. **Identify** – understand assets and environments to spot anomalies.
3. **Protect** – implement safeguards to reduce the likelihood and impact of
   incidents.
4. **Detect** – continuously monitor systems to discover incidents.
5. **Respond** – contain and mitigate the incident.
6. **Recover** – restore services and incorporate lessons learned【89264104650161†L470-L648】.

This model emphasizes that preparation (Govern, Identify, Protect) is an ongoing
part of cybersecurity risk management rather than a one‑time pre‑incident
activity.  It also highlights **continuous improvement**, encouraging
organizations to feed insights from incidents back into policies and controls.

## Integration with organizational operations

Revision 3 stresses that incident response is not an isolated activity but
should be integrated into broader operations.  It encourages coordination
across technical and non‑technical teams, alignment with business objectives
and regular testing of response plans.  Mapping to the CSF makes it easier
for organizations already using the framework to incorporate incident
handling【89264104650161†L470-L648】.

## Why it matters

Cyber incidents are more frequent and complex.  The updated guide provides a
flexible model that can adapt to evolving threats.  By integrating incident
response into continuous governance and risk management, organizations can
respond faster and recover more effectively【89264104650161†L470-L648】.

# NIST SP 800‑18 Revision 2: System Security, Privacy and Supply Chain Risk Management Plan

A system security plan documents how an organization protects a specific
information system.  NIST’s SP 800‑18 provides a template and guidance for
creating these plans.  **Revision 2** combines security, privacy and
cybersecurity supply chain risk management into a single integrated plan
【476605477197460†L119-L131】.

## What’s new

* **Consolidated planning:** Instead of separate documents for security,
  privacy and supply chain risks, the revised guideline combines them.  The
  plan now describes the *assets and individuals* within the system’s
  authorization boundary, the **system environment**, data flows and
  supply‑chain interactions【476605477197460†L119-L131】.
* **Comprehensive control summary:** The plan records which controls are
  already in place and which ones are planned.  This helps decision
  makers understand the system’s security posture at a glance.
* **Integrated risk management:** By considering cyber supply chain risks
  alongside security and privacy, organizations can identify dependencies on
  vendors and third parties.  This is increasingly important as
  vulnerabilities in suppliers’ products can compromise the system.
* **Public review:** The initial public draft invites comments so that the
  community can help refine the guidance.  NIST encourages feedback on
  whether the plan adequately captures the information needed to manage risk

## Why it matters

Information systems rarely operate in isolation.  They depend on software,
hardware and services from vendors and process personal data that requires
privacy protections.  Having one plan that covers security, privacy and
supply‑chain risks makes it easier for system owners to see the full picture
and to coordinate mitigation strategies.  Organizations preparing system
security plans should adopt the integrated approach outlined in SP 800‑18
Revision 2【476605477197460†L119-L131】.

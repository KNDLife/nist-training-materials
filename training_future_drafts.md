# Upcoming NIST Drafts: Rijndael‑256 and CSF 2.0 Quick‑Start Guide (SP 1331)

In addition to finalized standards, NIST periodically releases proposals and
quick‑start guides for public comment.  Two notable drafts from late 2024 and
2025 are the **Rijndael‑256** block cipher proposal and **SP 1331**
Quick‑Start Guide for the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.

## Rijndael‑256 – A wider variant of AES

The **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** currently specifies the use of
Rijndael with a 128‑bit block size.  Public feedback on block‑cipher modes
has highlighted the potential benefits of a larger block size for
applications that process very large data volumes.  On December 24, 2024
NIST announced its intent to develop a standard for **Rijndael‑256**—a
variant of AES with a 256‑bit block and 256‑bit key.  NIST invited
comments by **June 25, 2025** on areas such as security analysis and
performance impacts【882689850893941†L118-L139】.  The goal is to determine
whether standardizing a wider block cipher would provide practical benefits
without sacrificing security.

## SP 1331 – Quick‑Start Guide for Emerging Cybersecurity Risks

**SP 1331 (initial public draft)** is a quick‑start guide that helps
organizations use the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** to manage
emerging cybersecurity risks.  The guide explains how to integrate
framework practices with an organization’s enterprise risk management
program to proactively address risks before they materialize【848179036465159†L119-L132】.
The comment period for the draft ran through September 21, 2025.  This
resource is part of a series of quick‑start guides designed to make CSF 2.0
more accessible to different audiences.

## Why these drafts are relevant

Draft standards and guides allow stakeholders to provide input before final
versions are issued.  Participating in comment periods helps shape
cryptographic standards like Rijndael‑256 and ensures that guidance on
emerging risks reflects real‑world needs.  Organizations should monitor
NIST announcements and contribute feedback to stay ahead of evolving
security and privacy practices【882689850893941†L118-L139】【848179036465159†L119-L132】.
